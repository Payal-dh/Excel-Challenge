# Excel-Challenge

Since the late 2000s, crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have experienced tremendous growth in popularity and success. Both independent and renowned content creators are utilizing crowdfunding to launch new products and generate excitement. However, not all projects achieve success as funding is contingent on meeting or exceeding an initial goal. Consequently, many organizations devote significant resources to examining past projects in search of strategies that lead to success. In this week's Challenge, you will be responsible for organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any concealed trends.

## 1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

Based on the provided data, the three conclusions that we can draw out about crowdfunding data is there was a very successful rate for funding in the theaters field. The profit rate was very high compared to the other industry. The journalism industry has a lowest successful rate compared to any other industry.

## 2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not include most recent statistics for the current years, the lates year that has been provided is the year 2019, which was 3 years ago and due to the current circumstance of being in the pandemic, I believe if there was more accurate data the chart and graph would look a lot more different. 

## 3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
 Other possible tables/graphs that could be used to create the following study are;
	- Success of categories by countries.
	- Analysis of funding success and length rate, while looking at the relationship between the crowdfunding goals.
